      <h1>My hobbies</h1>
      <p>I don't have many hobbies and need to be more consistent with them.</p>
      <h2>Workuot</h2>
      <p>
        I have been going to the gym five days per week for about 6 months.
        I have gotten a lot fitter, but there hasn't been much of a physical change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The harder part is the nutrition.
        I was never good in eating a lot and you need to eat <strong>a lot</strong> to get bigger.
      </p>
      <h2>Volleyball</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not really good, but I like.
        My favorite is beach volleyball.
        I don't play since a long time and need to get back as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>I don't like playing with corrective glasses, but I'm also not a fan of contact lenses.</p>
      <h2>Reading</h2>
      <p>
        I need to read more literature.
        The last good book I read was <cite>Dune by Frank Herbert</cite>.
        I'm currently reading <cite>The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes by Amanda Ripley</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also read some manga. The last one was <cite>Hunter × Hunter by Yoshihiro Togashi</cite>.
